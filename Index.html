            <h2>Venice</h2>
            <div class="intro">
                &emsp;Venice is a city on an island where parts of it are built on the water. This city is very well known for their "Gondole", traditional venetian boats, which are often used for romantic trips around the city's canals. In order to get the full experience you would have to visit Venice at least twice: once during the Carnival, and once during the summer. At the plaza of St. Mark's Basilica is where most of the Carnival festival is taken place and where the majority of people pass in front of with boats. Another place commontly visited is the old bridge "Ponte Rialto", which tipycally has shops and little markets on it. A smaller less visited island, in the Venitian archipelago, is called Murano which is known for its glass making artisans. Another similarly named island is called Burano (not to be confused with Murano) which has a lot of colored houses and amazing scenary.

                &emsp;You can find many guides and maps that will help guid you through this beutiful city. However, my suggestion would be to throw them away and instead explore and discover all the beuties and wonders of Venice. Getting lost is one of the best things you can do as there are many great more reserved areas that many tourists are not able to see because they are too distracted by the main attractions which often filled with other tourists, making the experience less enjoyable.
